"""
Company terminology: what a business word means and where it lives in the
database.

This is the seed corpus for the vector store (see backend/tools/vector_tools.py)
and the fallback the context agent uses when the vector store is unavailable.

Add a new entry whenever someone asks a question the bot misreads because it
did not know a company-specific word.

Editing this file is enough to re-teach the bot: ensure_seeded() hashes it at
backend startup and re-embeds only when it has changed, so a restart is all
that is needed.

    Cheap fallback used when the vector store is not available, or when it

    Matches WHOLE WORDS and requires at least two of them. It used to do a bare
    substring test on any word over two characters, which is how "show scrap
    data for all available dates" ended up retrieving the export-paperwork term:
    "data" matched inside "database" and "available" matched inside the term's
    own "(NOT AVAILABLE)" label. The SQL agent was then told, with apparent
    authority, that the thing it was being asked about is not in the database -
    and refused, for a material with 10,311 issuance lines against it.

    Returning nothing is the RIGHT answer when nothing matches: the graph reads
    an empty context as "undocumented" and routes to the Knowledge Agent, which
    derives the mapping from the schema instead of guessing from noise.
