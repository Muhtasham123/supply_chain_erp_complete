"""
Database schema description handed to the SQL agent.

Two ways to get the schema:

  * DB_SCHEMA_TEXT below - a hand-written summary, always available, cheap in
    tokens, and works before the database is even up.
  * live_schema() - reads information_schema from the real database.

get_schema_text() prefers the live schema and falls back to the static one,
so the SQL agent keeps working while the database is still being built.

Keep DB_SCHEMA_TEXT in sync with the ERP models, which own the schema:
supply_chain_erp-master/app/{masters,imports,logistics,trucking}/models.py and
app/loading/schemas/*.py.

DB_SCHEMA_TEXT = """
=== HOW THIS DATABASE IS SHAPED (read first) ===

Two ID styles live side by side, and mixing them is the most common mistake:

  * The STORES tables (stock, issuance, store_requisition, purchases_data) key
    on items.item_code, a TEXT business code like '7230-60'. Join them with
      JOIN items i ON i.item_code = <table>.item_code
  * The ERP modules (imports, logistics, trucking) key on integer surrogate
    ids. consignment_items carries BOTH: item_id (integer -> items.id) and a
    copied item_code/item_name text snapshot taken when the line was entered.
    Join those on item_id.

SOFT DELETES. Every ERP table carries is_deleted; rows are never physically
removed. ALWAYS add "AND <alias>.is_deleted = false" when querying
consignments, consignment_items, logistics_*, trucking_*. The stores tables
(stock, issuance, store_requisition, purchases_data) have NO is_deleted column
- do not add the filter there, it will error.

DRAFT ROWS. consignments, logistics_consignments and trucking_consignments
carry record_state ('draft' / 'submitted'). Everything loaded from the
workbooks is 'draft'. Do NOT filter on record_state unless the user asks about
completeness - filtering it out hides essentially all historical data.

=== MASTER TABLES ===

items(id PK, item_code UNIQUE, name, default_specification,
      default_unit_of_measurement, category, is_active, is_verified)
    Item master. `name` is the item name (was `item`), `default_specification`
    the spec (was `specs`). There is NO material_standard or group_name column
    any more - `category` carries the grouping. Retired items have
    is_active = false, and many also have '(Deleted)' in their name.

suppliers(id PK, name, country, city, contact_name, phone, email,
          default_currency, default_payment_terms, is_active, is_verified)

branches(id PK, name, code, city, address, is_active, is_verified)
    THE IMPORTS BRANCH TABLE. `consignments.branch_id` -> `branches.id` is the
    only way imports carry a branch.
    `name` HOLDS THE SHORT CODE, not a legal name. The five real values are
    'QE', 'QEN', 'QCL', 'QBL-II', 'QH'.
    `code` IS NULL ON EVERY ROW - never filter or join on it, it matches nothing.
    RESOLVE IT THROUGH v_branch_aliases, never v_branches directly:
        JOIN branches br ON br.id = c.branch_id
        JOIN v_branch_aliases a ON a.alias = br.name
    The alias map carries every spelling including 'QBL-II' and 'QH', so EVERY
    consignment resolves - a row that fails to join is a bug, not an unknown
    branch. (An earlier version keyed on a `legal_name` column and had neither,
    which matched ZERO rows and is how "how many import consignments are of QE"
    once answered 0 when the true answer was 34.)
    Use LEFT JOIN when adding the branch for display - a consignment with a NULL
    branch_id exists and an INNER JOIN drops it.

works(id PK, name, code, ntn_strn, note, is_active, is_verified)
ports(id PK, name, country, port_type, un_locode, used_as, is_active)
clearing_agents(id PK, name, licence_no, contact_name, phone, primary_port_id)
hs_codes(id PK, item_id -> items.id, code, is_active)

=== STORES / INVENTORY ===

stock(id PK, item_code -> items.item_code, item_name, branch, hold_qty,
      stock_qty, stock_qty_amount, available_qty, available_amount,
      reorder_level, rank)
    Current snapshot, ONE ROW PER ITEM PER BRANCH. NOT a history table - it has
    no date column at all, so any "stock over time" question must be answered
    from issuance (consumption) or purchases_data (inflow) instead.
    COUNTING: because a stocked item has one row per branch, COUNT(*) here
    counts item-branch pairs, NOT items. Any "how many items ..." question must
    aggregate to item_code first (GROUP BY item_code, or COUNT(DISTINCT
    item_code)) or it overstates the answer - 1,407 rows are at or below zero
    available, but they are far fewer DISTINCT items - the gap is the whole
    point, and the live figures are in the profile block.
    available_qty = stock_qty - hold_qty, and it is the quantity actually
    usable; prefer it over stock_qty for anything about availability.
    `rank` is the business's A/B/C rarity class - A rarest, C least rare. It is
    per item PER BRANCH like everything else on this table, so one item can be
    A at one branch and C at another (103 of them are). Use it to PRIORITISE a
    list of items, never as a filter the user did not ask for. See the item
    rank term for the counting rules.
    `reorder_level` exists but is EMPTY on every row today - there is no safety
    stock or reorder policy in this data. Do not present it as one, and do not
    treat a NULL here as "reorder level is zero".

issuance(id PK, issuance_code, item_code -> items.item_code, item_name,
         specification, department, branch, issue_to_others, authorized_by,
         issued_by, received_by, description, ref_no, demand_ref_no,
         quantity, status, from_date, unit_price, total_price, job_number)
    Consumption transactions - the main demand history, and the largest
    table in the database. Its date range and row count are in the profile
    block, not here; they change on every load. from_date is the issue date; use it for consumption
    trends and burn-rate calculations.
    issuance_code is the issuance DOCUMENT number and is NOT unique: one
    document issues many items (thousands cover more than one item code, the
    largest covers 222). COUNT(*) counts issue LINES; for the number of
    issuance documents use COUNT(DISTINCT issuance_code).

store_requisition(id PK, item_code -> items.item_code, item_name, ref_no,
                  department, branch, prepare_date, description, required_by,
                  req_quantity, pur_quantity, pending_quantity, last_purchase,
                  previous_price, required_date, status, sourced_by,
                  previous_supplier, original_required_date, stock_in_date)
    Internal demand raised by departments. pending_quantity = not yet bought.

purchases_data(id PK, item_code -> items.item_code, item_name, specification,
               po_number, po_date, ref_no, qty, branch, amount, ppc_store,
               required_d, purchase, mop, dc_no, bill_no, sourcing_o, supplier)
    Local purchases. `purchase` is the date it landed
    and `required_d` the date it was needed - the gap between them is the
    observed procurement lead time. There is no separate purchase_order table
    any more; po_number and po_date live here.

    A SUPPLIER LIVES IN TWO PLACES. Local buying is purchases_data.supplier
    (free text); importing is consignments.supplier_id -> suppliers.name, with
    the value in consignments.pkr_total. They share no table and no key, so a
    "top supplier" ranking must say which scope it used. To combine them, UNION
    ALL the two sides into (supplier_name, value) and aggregate on the trimmed,
    lower-cased name - the same company is spelled differently across the two.

    `amount` IS THE MONEY (PKR) - the purchase value of that line, populated on
    every one of the 65,520 rows. `qty` is units and says nothing about worth.
    ANY question about value, spend, worth, cost or "biggest/top supplier"
    without a stated unit means SUM(amount), never SUM(qty). The two rank
    suppliers completely differently: by value the largest is 1.59bn on 5.4m
    units, while the largest by quantity is 21.2m units worth only 133m - so
    answering a value question with quantity names a different supplier
    entirely, not merely a different number. When a question could mean either,
    report by amount and say so.

=== IMPORTS ===

consignments(id PK, branch_id -> branches, supplier_id -> suppliers,
             clearing_agent_id -> clearing_agents,
             loading_port_id -> ports, delivery_port_id -> ports,
             requisition_date, works, origin, currency, consignment_type,
             incoterm, po_date, required_date, mode_of_shipment,
             cargo_readiness_date, etd, eta, eta_works, payment_instrument,
             instrument_number, opening_or_retirement_date, exchange_rate,
             rate_booked_on, rate_source, foreign_total, pkr_total,
             current_status, effective_date, remarks, gd_number,
             gd_filing_date, free_days_allowed, gate_out_date,
             demurrage_or_detention_paid, container_detention,
             record_state, is_locked, is_deleted, created_by_id)
    One import consignment (header). current_status is the transit status, in
    this order: 'TT/LC in Process', 'Under Production', 'Ready Awaiting
    Sailing', 'In Transit', 'Arrived at Port', 'Under Custom Clearance',
    'Under Examination', 'Under Assessment', 'Arrived at QFL', 'On Road',
    'Arrived at Works'. "On water" / "sailing" = 'In Transit'.
    NOTE: the old import_details.file_no commodity category ('Shafts',
    'Foundry Material', ...) does NOT exist in this schema. To find imports of
    a commodity, match consignment_items.item_name / description / item_code.

consignment_items(id PK, consignment_id -> consignments, item_id -> items.id,
                  item_code, item_name, specification, hs_code, quantity,
                  unit_price, unit_of_measurement, batch_no, requisition_type,
                  elc, alc, variance_absolute, variance_percentage,
                  reference_number, job_number, mo_number, description,
                  is_deleted)
    The item lines of an import. item_code/item_name are a text SNAPSHOT taken
    when the line was entered; item_id is the live link to the master. elc and
    alc are the estimated and actual landed cost, entered by hand per line.
    MOST IMPORT LINES ARE NOT IN THE ITEM MASTER. 294 of 451 lines (65%) have an
    item_code with no matching items row - 291 of those are `TMPNL...`
    placeholder codes created at entry time. So:
      * NEVER INNER JOIN consignment_items to items. It silently discards
        two thirds of every import answer. Use LEFT JOIN, always.
      * To find an item on the import side, match the line's OWN text -
        ci.item_name ILIKE '%hardner%' - NOT items.name through a join.
        Asked whether any hardner is imported, a join through items found ONE
        code; matching ci.item_name found FOUR (26382-60, 26838-60, TMPNL0069,
        TMPNL0125) across 8 lines. Three of those four are absent from the
        master entirely.
      * The snapshot and the master can also DISAGREE on spelling for the same
        code ('Hardener' vs 'Hardner' on 26382-60), so match both spellings.
    Corollary: an item can be actively imported and still have NO stock row and
    NO master row. A stock-based query cannot see it - say so rather than
    reporting "not imported".

eta_revision_history(id PK, consignment_id -> consignments, eta_type,
                     previous_eta, new_eta, cause_of_revision, user_id)
    One row per ETA change. SLIPPAGE = the current eta minus the FIRST
    previous_eta ever recorded for that consignment.

    SLIPPAGE IS NOT DELAY, and this table is NOT how you answer "how many
    imports are delayed". Slippage measures how far a promise MOVED; delay
    measures whether the goods arrived later than they were NEEDED. A
    consignment whose ETA was revised three times but still reached the works
    before its required date is not late, and one that never moved its ETA can
    be months late. Answering the delay question from here returned 82 where
    the business definition gives 50.
    For anything about late, delayed, on-time or days late, use
    v_import_delivery_delay. Use this table only when the question is about ETA
    CHANGES, revisions, or why a date moved (cause_of_revision).

status_update_history(id PK, consignment_id -> consignments, previous_status,
                      new_status, effective_date, remarks, user_id)
payments(id PK, consignment_id -> consignments, retirement_date, value,
         payment_exchange_rate, bank_charges, status, bank_reference,
         is_deleted)

=== LOGISTICS IS FOUR SEPARATE THINGS - DO NOT MIX THEM ===

"Logistics" covers four distinct activities. They live in different tables,
answer different questions, and their row counts are NOT comparable. Decide
which one the question is about before writing anything, and never add them
together into a single "logistics" total.

  1. EXPORT / LOCAL ORDERS - logistics_consignments (+ logistics_items)
     The order itself: customer, incoterm, ports, shipping line, costs, status.
     "How many export orders", "which orders are sailing", "export costs".

  2. PACKING - logistics_packages
     How the goods were boxed: packing works, colour code, packing dates,
     packing cost, gross weight. One row per packing record, several per order.
     "Packing delays", "packing cost", "what is packed".

  3. CONTAINERS - logistics_containers
     One row per container booked against an order, with its type.
     "How many containers", "container mix". Note container_no is NULL on every
     row - the source recorded a COUNT per type, not registration numbers.

  4. TRUCKING / INBOUND-OUTBOUND - trucking_consignments (+ trucking_vehicles)
     Road movement, a SEPARATE module with no foreign key to the above. The
     only link is reference_no as free text, so never invent a join between
     trucking and logistics.

EXPORT DOCUMENTATION is a fifth activity the business tracks, but it is NOT in
this database - no table holds a document status. Say so plainly when asked;
do not substitute logistics_consignments.current_status, which is the shipment
stage and says nothing about paperwork.

A question that names one of these means only that one. "How many shipments"
is ambiguous across (1) and (4) - ask, or answer both with a label saying which
is which.

=== LOGISTICS / EXPORTS ===

logistics_consignments(id PK, order_type, department, origin_country,
                       origin_city, origin_province, customer_name, mo_no,
                       batch_no, batch_label, incoterm, pol, pod,
                       shipping_line, clearing_agent, booking_no,
                       port_in_date, etd_sailing_date, cro_arrival_date,
                       actual_arrival_date, packing_cost,
                       transportation_charges, container_detention, insurance,
                       trucking_lhr_to_khi, fumigation_cost, lashing,
                       qfl_charges, qfl_container_movement,
                       custom_clearance_charges, port_charges, dhl_charges,
                       sea_air_freight, current_status, effective_date,
                       gate_out_date, sent_to_trucking, record_state,
                       is_locked, is_deleted, created_by_id)
    One outbound order (export or local). order_type is 'Export' or 'Local';
    department is the product line ('Sugar', 'Cement'). mo_no holds the EXPORT
    NUMBER and batch_label the batch - together they identify the order in the
    business's own language.
    current_status - THE SEVEN VALUES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST, with live counts:
        The live values and counts are in the profile block - do NOT rely
        'Delivered' 111 | 'On Water' 38 | 'At QFL' 10 | 'At Port' 4
    There is NO 'Sailing', NO 'Gate Out' and NO 'Packed' in this column - those
    are the ERP's enum names, not what the loaders wrote. Filtering on them
    returns 0 rows and no error. Not-yet-shipped is 'Under Production' /
    'Under Packing'; shipped-not-arrived is whatever remains after those;
    arrived-not-closed is 'At Port' / 'At QFL' - THESE COUNT AS ARRIVED, NOT
    in transit (business rule); closed is 'Delivered'.
    The cost columns are the export expenditure breakdown; total shipping cost
    is their sum, not a stored column.

logistics_items(id PK, consignment_id -> logistics_consignments, job_no,
                item_detail, quantity, unit_weight, gross_weight,
                planned_rfd_date, actual_rfd_date, is_deleted)
    What is on the order. RFD = Ready For Dispatch; planned vs actual measures
    schedule adherence. job_no may hold several joined job numbers.

logistics_packages(id PK, consignment_id -> logistics_consignments,
                   colour_code, packing_works, packing_ready_date,
                   packing_date, quoted_packing_cost, actual_packing_cost,
                   gross_weight, status, is_deleted)
    One row per packing record. status - the four real values, with counts:
        'Packed' 793 | 'Packing under manufacturing' 135 | 'Under Packing' 28
        'Under Final Packing' 6
    There is no 'Pending' and no 'Gate Out' here. Note 'Under Packing' means
    something different in this column than in logistics_consignments -
    a package still being packed, not an order still being packed.

logistics_containers(id PK, consignment_id -> logistics_consignments,
                     container_no, container_type, is_deleted)
    One row per container. container_type is like "20' Standard",
    "40' Flat Rack", 'LCL', 'AIR'. container_no is usually NULL for loaded
    history - the source recorded counts per type, not individual numbers.

NOTE - export paperwork is NOT in this database. The source workbook tracks 22
    documents per export (customs / customer / bank invoices, packing lists,
    bills of lading, GD, certificates of origin), but no table holds a document
    status. Questions about pending paperwork, document completion percentages
    or "which documents are outstanding" CANNOT be answered - say so plainly
    rather than substituting logistics_consignments.current_status, which is
    the shipment stage and means something different.

logistics_status_history(id PK, consignment_id, previous_status, new_status,
                         effective_date, remarks, user_id)

=== TRUCKING (road movements) ===

trucking_consignments(id PK, movement_type, source, source_ref,
                      execution_date, transporter_name, shifting_type,
                      item_details, pickup, destination, reference_no,
                      quoted_freight, actual_freight, payment_status,
                      paid_amount, detention, dispatch_note_date, eta_works,
                      remarks, record_state, is_locked, is_deleted,
                      created_by_id)
    One trucking job. movement_type is 'Inbound' / 'Outbound' /
    'Intrafactory'. reference_no is the shipment reference or IDM number.
    Freight savings = quoted_freight - actual_freight (computed, not stored).
    There is NO job-level status column - status lives on each vehicle.

trucking_vehicles(id PK, consignment_id -> trucking_consignments,
                  vehicle_number, vehicle_type, no_of_packages, driver_phone,
                  net_weight, gross_weight, container_no, container_type,
                  tracking_status, is_deleted)
    One row per truck. A job moves on several trucks, each advancing on its
    own. tracking_status has EXACTLY TWO values in the data:
        'Delivered' 246 | 'Going to load' 218
    So on the road there is no in-between: a truck is delivered or it is not.
    "In transit by road" therefore means tracking_status <> 'Delivered', not
    some third status. A job counts as closed only when EVERY one of its
    vehicles is 'Delivered'.

=== SYSTEM (rarely useful for business questions) ===

users(id PK, username, role_id -> roles, is_active), roles(id PK, name),
activity_logs(id PK, user_id, username, action, method, path, entity_type,
              entity_id, status_code, detail, created_at)

=== SEMANTIC VIEWS - PREFER THESE OVER REBUILDING THE DEFINITION ===

There is deliberately NO view for shafts or scrap. A material named in a
question is just an item whose NAME contains that word - derive it in SQL
with items.name ~* '[[:<:]]word s?[[:>:]]' (whole word, singular stem), and
say in the answer which rule you used so the user can correct it.
The one exception is IMPORTED shafts, which are a fixed three-type list -
see v_import_shafts.


Each of these encodes a business definition that is easy to get subtly wrong.
When a question is about one of them, SELECT FROM THE VIEW rather than writing
the filter yourself: the view is the definition, and rewriting it by hand is
how the same question ends up with different answers on different runs.

v_item_stock_position(item_code, item_name, branches_held_at, stock_qty,
                      hold_qty, available_qty, stock_amount, available_amount,
                      is_out_of_stock, rank, branch_ranks)
    Stock collapsed to ONE ROW PER ITEM across all branches. Use this for any
    "how many items ..." stock question - the raw `stock` table has one row per
    item per branch, so counting it counts item-branch pairs instead.

    THE VALUE OF INVENTORY IS stock_amount, NOT available_amount.
    "What is our inventory worth / value of stock / how much is inventory" =
    SUM(stock_amount) - everything held, including reserved stock, because
    stock on hold is committed but still owned. available_amount is the
    narrower "what could we use or sell today" figure and is 121.7m lower;
    answering the ownership question with it understates inventory by 12%.
    Use available_amount only when the user explicitly asks about unreserved,
    usable or sellable value, and say which one you used.

v_out_of_stock_items(item_code, item_name, rank, branch_ranks, branches_held_at,
                     stock_qty, hold_qty, available_qty)
    THE definition of "out of stock": items with nothing usable left ANYWHERE.
    An item at zero in one branch while another still holds it is not here.
    871 items.

    NEVER answer an out-of-stock question by writing `available_qty <= 0`
    against `stock`. That is a different and larger set (1,160 items - anything
    empty at any single branch), and using it alongside this view makes "how
    many items are out of stock" and "which branch has the most" contradict
    each other on screen. Use this view, or the branch split below.

v_out_of_stock_by_branch(branch, item_code, item_name, rank, branch_rank,
                         branch_stock_qty, branch_hold_qty,
                         branch_available_qty, branches_held_at)
    The SAME 871 items broken out by the branches that stock them - use this
    for "which branch has the most out-of-stock items". Derived from the view
    above, so branch figures can never disagree with the company total.

    WHEN REPORTING: an item stocked at three branches appears three times, so
    branch counts sum to MORE than 871. Say "items affected at this branch";
    never say or imply that the branches divide the 871 between them.

v_branch_depleted_items(branch, item_code, item_name, branch_rank,
                        branch_stock_qty, branch_hold_qty, branch_available_qty,
                        company_available_qty, out_of_stock_company_wide)
    A DIFFERENT question: what has run dry AT ONE BRANCH, whether or not
    another branch can cover it. Call these DEPLETED AT THAT BRANCH - never
    "out of stock". An item empty here with 500 at the next branch is a
    TRANSFER, not a purchase. Use it for "what has run out at <branch>";
    out_of_stock_company_wide tells you which of them are genuinely out of
    stock as well.

v_item_movement(item_code, item_name, rank, available_qty, stock_value,
                available_amount, last_issued_on, issued_value_3m,
                issued_value_12m, last_purchased_on, movement, data_through)
    FAST / SLOW / DEAD, matching the inventory dashboard exactly:
      Fast moving  1,535 items, PKR 765,732,001   issued within 3 months
      Slow moving  1,011 items, PKR  97,279,118   not in 3, but within 12
      Dead         1,269 items, PKR  71,477,136   neither, and still on a shelf
    Windows end at the latest issuance in the data, not today, and issuance is
    counted company-wide.

    MOVEMENT IS NULL FOR 947 ITEMS, and that is deliberate, not missing data:
    an item with nothing available (depleted or fully on hold) has no stock
    sitting idle, and one purchased within the last 12 months has not had time
    to move. Neither is Dead. Exclude NULLs when reporting the split - they
    belong to no class - and never fold them into Dead.

    Report BOTH count and value. Dead is a quarter of the catalogue but under a
    tenth of the money; either number alone tells the wrong story.

    v_dead_stock answers nearly the same question by a slightly different route
    (1,249 items) and carries the days-since-issue and days-since-purchase
    detail. Use THIS view for the split and to match the dashboard tile; use
    that one when the question is about the idle money itself.

v_item_reorder_level(item_code, reorder_level, demand_180d, avg_lead_days,
                     uses_default_lead, branches_with_demand)
    THE REORDER LEVEL, derived exactly as the inventory dashboard derives it:
    (demand over the last 180 days / 180) x observed lead time x 1.2, where
    demand is requisitioned quantity and lead time is the average requisition
    cycle (stock_in_date - prepare_date). The 1.2 IS the safety policy.

    "How many items are below reorder level" =
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_item_stock_position p
      JOIN v_item_reorder_level rl ON rl.item_code = p.item_code
      WHERE p.available_qty > 0 AND p.available_qty < rl.reorder_level
    which gives 105, matching the dashboard.

    AN ITEM ABSENT FROM THIS VIEW HAS NO LEVEL, not a level of zero - nothing
    was requisitioned for it in the window, so it cannot be "below" anything.
    An item at zero available is OUT OF STOCK, a different question.

v_import_delivery_delay(consignment_id, instrument_number, supplier, origin,
                        required_date, eta_works, current_status, pkr_total,
                        days_late, delay_status, within_grace)
    WHETHER AN IMPORT WAS LATE. days_late = eta_works - required_date;
    delay_status is 'Delayed' when that exceeds 7 days, 'On time' at 7 or
    below (including early), and 'Not measurable' when either date is missing.
    The 7-day grace and the use of eta_works both match the imports dashboard,
    so the tile and the answer cannot disagree.

    A PERCENTAGE HERE MUST CARRY ITS BASIS. Most consignments are 'Not
    measurable', so a delay rate is a share of the measurable ones only - say
    "52.6% of the 95 that can be measured". Never count the unmeasurable ones
    as on time.

    Average days late is over delay_status = 'Delayed' rows only; early
    arrivals are not negative delays to net off. days_late is the full lag,
    not the excess beyond the grace period.

v_stock_runway(branch, stock_value, available_value, issued_value_12m,
               days_of_stock, items, data_through)
    HOW LONG THE STOCK LASTS, per branch, computed IN VALUE:
    stock value / (value issued over 12 months / 365).

    USE THIS for "days of stock", "stock runway", "how long will our stock
    last" about the COMPANY, a BRANCH, or stock as a whole.

    NEVER compute it from quantities. SUM(available_qty) / (SUM(issued_qty)/365)
    adds kilograms to pieces to litres - the catalogue is held in four
    different units - so both halves of that fraction are meaningless. It
    returned 41.9 days where the true figure is 82.9.

    THE OVERALL NUMBER IS NOT THE AVERAGE OF THE ROWS - averaging days weights
    a tiny store like the main one. Aggregate the money and divide once:
      SELECT SUM(stock_value) / NULLIF(SUM(issued_value_12m)/365.0, 0)
      FROM v_stock_runway
    days_of_stock is NULL for a branch with no issuance - it has no runway,
    which is not the same as a long one.

    For ONE NAMED ITEM use v_item_demand_picture.days_of_cover instead: a
    single item has a single unit, so a quantity-based cover is sound there.

v_dead_stock(item_code, item_name, rank, branch_ranks, branches_held_at,
             available_qty, idle_value, total_value, last_issued_on,
             days_since_issue, ever_issued, last_purchased_on,
             days_since_purchase, data_through)
    DEAD STOCK - one row per item. The definition, and the only place it
    lives: holds stock (available_qty > 0), has had NO issuance in the last
    365 days, and its last purchase was over 365 days ago so it has had a year
    to move. Do not rebuild this from `issuance` and `stock` by hand, and do
    not state a count or a value for it without querying - the numbers move
    every time data is loaded.

    RANK BY idle_value, NOT by count or quantity. 40 kg of one item and 40
    tonnes of another are not the same problem; the money not moving is the
    point of the question.

    ever_issued = false means it has NEVER been issued since records began,
    which is a stronger finding than "not issued lately" and worth saying
    separately.

    days_since_purchase IS NULL means no purchase record exists. That is NOT
    recent stock: purchase history only starts in 2023, so these are the OLDEST
    holdings. Say the age is unknown rather than implying it is new or omitting
    the item.

    Items bought within the last year are deliberately EXCLUDED - unsold and
    new is not dead. If the user asks about those, they are asking a different
    question and it needs its own answer, not this view.

v_item_types(item_type, display_name, item_codes, category)
    One row per distinct item NAME. A "type" is a name, not an item_code -
    each code is a name+spec variant. COUNT(*) here answers "how many types".

v_item_consumption_monthly(item_code, period, quantity, value, issue_lines)
    The demand signal: issued quantity per item per month, already restricted
    to status 'Issue' (excluding 'Hold' / 'HoldIssuence', which are not
    consumption). Use this for trends, burn rate and forecast series.

=== WHICH DATE TO FILTER ON ===

Picking a date column that looks right but is empty, or that means something
else, has produced two confidently wrong answers already. Both looked fine.

  ALWAYS EMPTY - a filter on these returns ZERO ROWS, which reads as "nothing
  happened" rather than "wrong column":
    consignments.effective_date        NULL on all 178
    consignments.po_date               NULL on all 178
  "No shaft imports this month" was produced exactly this way, hiding 24 lines
  worth PKR 53.6m.

  IMPORTS (consignments) - use eta_works:
    eta_works              97.8% filled   arrival at the factory. THE default,
                                          and what the imports dashboard uses.
    eta / etd              90.4%          port arrival / sailing - different
                                          questions, not "when did it land"
    requisition_date       56.2%
    gd_filing_date         55.6%
    cargo_readiness_date   41.0%

  EXPORTS / LOGISTICS (logistics_consignments):
    updated_at            100%   the ROW's own timestamp - the only complete
                                 date here, and the honest answer to "recorded"
    created_at            present - when the record was created
    etd_sailing_date      32.8%  sailing
    effective_date        24.2%  ARRIVAL. It equals actual_arrival_date on
                                 every row that has it - it is NOT a "recorded"
                                 or status-change date, and filtering on it
                                 silently drops the 76% of rows where it is
                                 NULL.
    actual_arrival_date   24.2%  same dates as effective_date
    port_in_date          24.2%
    gate_out_date         13.2%

  STORES: issuance.from_date is the issuance date (100%).
  PURCHASES: purchases_data.purchase is when it landed, required_d when it was
  needed, po_date when ordered - all filled.

  WHEN A COLUMN IS UNDER ~50% FILLED, SAY SO. A count filtered on a sparse date
  is a count of the rows that happen to carry it, not of what happened; state
  the basis or choose a fuller column.

=== TWO PATTERNS TO WRITE YOURSELF ===

These used to be views. Write them directly - but write them THIS way, because
both have a trap, and the in-transit one carries a business ruling you must not
re-derive: 'At Port' and 'At QFL' are ARRIVED, not in transit.

GOODS IN TRANSIT - inbound and outbound live in different tables with different
vocabulary, so a question about what is moving needs BOTH sides UNIONed, with a
literal label saying which side each row came from:

    SELECT 'Import' AS direction, c.id, c.instrument_number AS reference,
           s.name AS counterparty, c.current_status, c.etd, c.eta
    FROM consignments c
    LEFT JOIN suppliers s ON s.id = c.supplier_id
    WHERE c.is_deleted = false AND c.current_status ILIKE '%in transit%'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Export', lc.id, lc.mo_no, lc.customer_name, lc.current_status,
           lc.etd_sailing_date, lc.actual_arrival_date
    FROM logistics_consignments lc
    WHERE lc.is_deleted = false
      AND lc.current_status NOT IN ('Under Production', 'Under Packing',
                                    'At Port', 'At QFL', 'Delivered')
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Road', tc.id, tc.reference_no, tc.customer_name, 'Going to load',
           tc.created_at::date, NULL
    FROM trucking_consignments tc
    WHERE tc.is_deleted = false
      AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM trucking_vehicles tv
                  WHERE tv.consignment_id = tc.id AND tv.is_deleted = false
                    AND tv.tracking_status <> 'Delivered')

    NARROWING IT TO ONE MATERIAL (shafts, resin, scrap) does NOT change the
    counting unit. Join to the line table to filter, then count the CONSIGNMENT:

        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
            SELECT DISTINCT lc.id
            FROM logistics_consignments lc
            JOIN logistics_items li ON li.consignment_id = lc.id
             AND li.is_deleted = false
            WHERE lc.is_deleted = false
              AND li.item_detail ~* '[[:<:]]shafts?[[:>:]]'
              AND lc.current_status NOT IN ('Under Production', 'Under Packing',
                                    'At Port', 'At QFL', 'Delivered')
            ...same for the imports and road arms...
        ) t

    One consignment carrying eight shaft lines is ONE shipment, not eight.
    Counting lines on one arm and consignments on another returned 19, 5, 18 and
    13 for the same question on four consecutive runs - the arms were right
    every time, only the unit moved.

    The trap is answering from ONE side and reporting it as the whole picture.
    NO STATUS STRING EXISTS ON MORE THAN ONE SIDE. Inbound says 'In Transit';
    outbound uses its own set (see the profile); road says 'Going to load'.
    Filtering all three on one vocabulary returns 0 from the other two and
    reports it as an answer.

PROCUREMENT LEAD TIME - observed from history, because there is no planning
table in this schema (the old ab_items with lead_time_days and safety_days is
gone, and safety days have NO source at all):

    SELECT p.item_code,
           COUNT(*) AS purchases,
           percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY (p.purchase - p.required_d))
               AS median_lead_days
    FROM purchases_data p
    WHERE p.purchase IS NOT NULL AND p.required_d IS NOT NULL
      AND p.purchase >= p.required_d
    GROUP BY p.item_code

    The trap is AVG instead of the median - one stalled order then sets the
    planning figure for the item. Also exclude rows where purchase < required_d
    (arrived before it was needed); those are data errors, not negative lead
    times, and they drag the average below zero.

=== JOIN NOTES ===

* Stores tables join to items on TEXT item_code:
    JOIN items i ON i.item_code = s.item_code
* consignment_items joins to items on INTEGER item_id -> items.id. It also
  carries its own item_code text snapshot; prefer item_id for the join.
* Imports fan out: consignments -> consignment_items / eta_revision_history /
  status_update_history / payments, all on consignment_id.
* Logistics fans out: logistics_consignments -> logistics_items /
  logistics_packages / logistics_containers, all on consignment_id.
* Trucking fans out: trucking_consignments -> trucking_vehicles on
  consignment_id.
* Trucking is NOT linked to logistics or imports by a foreign key. The link is
  by reference_no text only, so do not invent a join between them.
* store_requisition.ref_no matches purchases_data.ref_no but has no FK.
* Always filter is_deleted = false on consignments, consignment_items,
  logistics_* and trucking_*. The stores
  tables have no such column.
* `stock` has no date column - it is a snapshot. Any question about stock
  "over time" must use issuance (consumption) or purchases_data (inflow).
