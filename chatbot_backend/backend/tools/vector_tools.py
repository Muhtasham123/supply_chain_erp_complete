"""
Vector store for business terminology, learned mappings and company documents.

Backed by Chroma persisted on disk (path from VECTOR_DIR in .env), embedded
with OpenAI. Chroma is a lazy import: if it is not installed, or the store has
not been seeded yet, search() falls back to keyword matching over
backend/metadata/business_terms.py so the graph still works end to end.

Three kinds of content live here, separated by the "kind" metadata field:

    kind="term"    : curated business terminology + its database mapping
                     (backend/metadata/business_terms.py). Hand-maintained.
    kind="learned" : mappings the Knowledge Agent inferred from the schema that
                     then produced a working query. Auto-saved for reuse, and
                     mirrored to LEARNED_TERMS_PATH for human review.
    kind="doc"     : policy/process documents, for the RAG agent.

Two lifecycle entry points:

    ensure_seeded()        - called at startup. Re-seeds the curated terms only
                             when business_terms.py actually changed (hash), and
                             syncs learned mappings from disk. No manual re-seed.
    persist_learned_term() - called after a successful knowledge-inferred turn.

Run `python -m backend.tools.vector_tools` to force a seed; add --list-learned
or --clear-learned to inspect or wipe the learned store.

    The embedding client, with an EXPLICIT timeout - do not remove it.

    Default is `timeout=None`, which was costing whole minutes per turn. The
    HTTP pool drops an idle connection after ~5s, and every turn leaves a much
    longer gap than that while the chat model thinks. The next embed_query then
    writes into a half-open socket, and with no timeout it blocks until the OS
    TCP retransmit gives up before retrying.

    Measured, one 124-character query:
        back-to-back                 ~290 ms
        after a 10s idle gap      23,498 ms   <- one call, one turn
        same gap, timeout=10s      1,971 ms

    Every turn embeds once (context_agent), so this was ~42% of turn time and
    the single biggest cause of "it took a minute to answer". The timeout is
    what turns a dead connection into a fast retry instead of a stall.
