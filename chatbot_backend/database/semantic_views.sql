--  Semantic views: business definitions as CODE, not as prose.
--
--  Every wrong answer this project has produced came from the same place - a
--  business word ("shaft", "scrap", "out of stock", "type") described in
--  English in a prompt, and re-interpreted by the model on every single run.
--  Prose is ambiguous to the same model that misreads the schema:
--
--    * "match bar and shaft" was read as SQL AND, requiring both words, and
--      returned 0
--    * '\ybar\y' was written '\\ybar\\y', which looks for a literal backslash,
--      and returned 0
--    * ILIKE '%bar%' matched Barrel, Barbed Wire and Wheelbarrow
--    * "out of stock" was counted over stock ROWS (one per item per branch),
--      giving 1,407 where the answer is 871
--
--  A view cannot be misread. It is written once, verified once, and every
--  query selects FROM it. Change the definition here and every answer that
--  depends on it changes with it - there is no second copy in a prompt to
--  drift out of step.
--
--  Apply with:  psql -d supply_chain_db -f database/semantic_views.sql
--  Re-runnable: every view is CREATE OR REPLACE.

-- v_branches - every spelling of a branch, mapped to one canonical code
--
-- SEVEN branches, codes confirmed by the business:
--     QBL2  Qadri Brothers Unit 2      (also written QB2, QBL-II)
--     QBL   Qadri Brothers
--     QCL   Qadcast
--     QE    Qadbros Engineering
--     QE2   Qadbros Engineering Unit 2 (also written QE-II)
--     QEN   Qadri Engineering
--     IOL   Izmir Office Lahore        (also "Corporate Office Izmir")
--
-- This view exists because the SAME branch is written differently in every
-- table, and no column anywhere records the mapping:
--     stock / issuance / store_requisition   full legal name
--     purchases_data                         short code (QB2, QE-II)
--     branches (the imports master)          short code (QBL-II); its own
--                                            `code` column is NULL on every row
--     logistics_packages / trucking          short code
--
-- The codes are a trap: QE is QadBROS, QEN is QadRI. Guessing
-- "Qadri Engineering -> QE" returns a DIFFERENT COMPANY's numbers, with no
-- error and a plausible figure.
--
-- TWO views, on purpose, because ONE was a trap.
--
-- The first attempt was a single view with one row per alias, carrying
-- branch_code alongside. Joining it on `alias` is correct; joining it on
-- `branch_code` - the obvious thing to write, and what the model wrote -
-- matched every alias row sharing that code and DOUBLED the answer:
-- QEN purchases came back 40,416 instead of 20,208, with no error.
--
-- Split so that NEITHER view has a repeating join key:
--     v_branches         one row per branch  (branch_code unique)  - 7 rows
--     v_branch_aliases   one row per spelling (alias unique)       - 20 rows
-- Any join to either one is now safe; fan-out is impossible.
--
--     -- a column holding codes OR legal names - always via the alias map:
--     JOIN v_branch_aliases a ON a.alias = purchases_data.branch
--     JOIN v_branch_aliases a ON a.alias = issuance.branch
--     GROUP BY a.branch_code
--
--     -- add the display name only when you need it:
--     JOIN v_branches b ON b.branch_code = a.branch_code

-- v_import_shafts - shafts as they are IMPORTED
--
-- Exactly three types, per the business:
--     Forged Steel Round Bar
--     Forged Steel Hollow Drill Bar
--     Forged Alloy Steel Round Bar
--
-- These live on the import LINES (consignment_items), NOT in the item master -
-- searching `items` for them returns nothing, which is why this view reads
-- consignment_items directly. shaft_type normalises the three spellings
-- (the workbook writes "Drill Bars" plural on some rows) so a count by type
-- gives three groups rather than five.
--
-- ONLY for the imports context. A general question about shafts is NOT this
-- view - it is the items actually named shaft, derived in SQL:
--     WHERE items.name ~* '[[:<:]]shafts?[[:>:]]'
-- There is deliberately no v_shaft_items: outside imports "shaft" means what
-- the name says, and if the user disagrees with the set, ask them rather than
-- freezing a different guess into a view.

--

-- scheduling noise, and counting it made the figure describe the shipping
-- calendar instead of a problem worth acting on. This matches the imports
-- dashboard exactly, so the tile and the chatbot cannot disagree.
--
-- ETA WORKS, NOT PORT ARRIVAL. eta_works is arrival at the factory, which is
-- the date the business schedules against - not eta (the port) and not
-- gate_out_date.
--
-- NOT MEASURABLE IS ITS OWN ANSWER. A consignment missing either date cannot be
-- judged late or on time, and must not be quietly counted as on time - that is
-- how a delay rate gets flattered. 79 of 178 consignments are in this state, so
-- the basis travels with any percentage: say "52.6% of the 95 that can be
-- measured", never a bare percentage of everything.
--
-- days_late IS THE FULL LAG, not the excess over the grace period - a
-- consignment 41 days past its required date is 41 days late, and the 7 days
-- decide only WHETHER it counts, not by how much. Average days late covers the
-- DELAYED ones only: arriving early is not a negative delay to net off against

--                                   365 days ('Hold' and 'HoldIssuence' are
--                                   reservations, not movement)
--   * it has HAD a year to move     its most recent purchase is more than 365
--                                   days ago - "365 days since its purchase"
--
-- WHY THE PURCHASE CLAUSE MATTERS. Without it, anything bought recently and not
-- yet issued counts as dead: 344 items are in exactly that position and they
-- are not dead, they are new. That is the difference between 1,592 items and
-- 1,248.
--
-- AN ITEM WITH NO PURCHASE RECORD IS STILL INCLUDED, deliberately. Purchase
-- history only reaches back to 2023-01, so 735 items holding stock have no
-- purchase row at all - they are the OLDEST stock in the building, not the
-- newest. Requiring a purchase date to prove age would drop precisely the
-- items most likely to be dead. Age is unknown for them, not recent, and
-- days_since_purchase is NULL so an answer can say so.
--
-- Built on v_item_stock_position rather than re-summing `stock`, so "how much
-- is available" means the same thing here as everywhere else.
--
-- The window is CURRENT_DATE-based, like v_item_demand_picture. data_through is
-- carried so an answer can say how fresh the issuance data is: after a long gap
-- with no data load, "no issuance in 365 days" starts to mean "no data for
-- part of that year", and the reader needs to be able to tell.

-- v_item_movement - fast / slow / dead, the inventory dashboard's split
--
--   Fast moving  issued within the last 3 months
--   Slow moving  not issued in the last 3 months, but issued in the last 12
--   Dead         not issued in the last 12 months at all
--
-- One class per item, decided in that order, so every stocked item lands in
-- exactly one bucket. The windows end at the LATEST ISSUANCE IN THE DATA, not
-- at today, so a gap since the last load cannot push live items into "dead".
--
-- NOTE ON THE WORD "DEAD". This is the MOVEMENT sense - purely "has not been
-- issued in a year". v_dead_stock is stricter: it also requires stock on hand
-- and a purchase more than a year old, so that a thing bought last month and
-- not yet issued is not called dead. The two answer different questions and
-- give different counts; use this view when the question is about the fast /
-- slow / dead SPLIT, and v_dead_stock when it is about money sitting idle.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THREE RULES DECIDE THE NUMBERS, all taken from the dashboard so the split
-- matches it exactly (Fast 1,535 / Slow 1,011 / Dead 1,269):
--
--  * ISSUANCE IS COUNTED COMPANY-WIDE, per item, across every branch that
--    issued it - not only the branches the stock snapshot still lists. An item
--    issued at a site that no longer holds a stock row is still moving.
--
--  * NOTHING AVAILABLE MEANS UNCLASSIFIED, NOT DEAD. An item fully depleted or
--    fully on hold has no stock sitting idle, so it is left out of the split
--    (movement NULL) rather than counted as Dead. Dead is money on a shelf.
--
--  * A RECENT PURCHASE BUYS TIME. Bought within the last 12 months and not yet
--    issued is new, not dead - the same benefit of the doubt v_dead_stock
--    gives. Purchase dates come from purchases_data.purchase for the four
--    branch codes that map onto stock branches, and any one of them inside the
--    window is enough.
--
--  EVERY ISSUANCE STATUS COUNTS HERE, not just 'Issue'. That is the
--  dashboard's rule and the ONE PLACE in this file where Hold and
--  HoldIssuence are treated as movement - v_item_consumption_monthly and
--  v_stock_runway both count 'Issue' alone, because a reservation is not
--  consumption.

-- v_item_reorder_level - the level below which an item needs replenishing
--
-- THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION, the same one the inventory dashboard uses:
--
--     reorder level = (demand over the last 180 days / 180)
--                     x observed lead time
--                     x 1.2                       (a 20% safety buffer)
--
-- DEMAND comes from store_requisition.req_quantity - what departments actually
-- ASKED FOR - over the 180 days ending at the latest requisition in the data,
-- not at today, so a gap since the last load cannot silently shrink it.
--
-- LEAD TIME is observed per item AND branch: the average of
-- (stock_in_date - prepare_date) over every completed requisition cycle, using
-- ALL history rather than the 180-day window, because a slow-moving item may
-- have only one or two completed cycles ever. 30 days is the fallback where
-- there is no completed cycle at all.
--
-- SUMMED ACROSS BRANCHES for the item-level threshold: an item needs cover at
-- every branch that stocks it, so the business-wide level is the sum of the
-- per-branch levels, matching group_by_item in the dashboard.
--
-- THIS IS NOT "no reorder level is stored". It is derived, it is defined, and
-- the answer to "how many items are below reorder level" is 105 - refusing the
-- question because safety days are not recorded was wrong: the 20% buffer IS
-- the safety policy.
--
-- Items with NO demand in the window have NO reorder level and are absent from
-- this view. Nothing was asked for, so there is nothing to be short of; do not
-- read a missing row as a level of zero.

--

--     stock value / (value issued over 12 months / 365)
--
-- Quantities cannot be added across items. Stock is held in kg, pieces, litres

-- bits and produces a number with no meaning - and then divides it by another
-- meaningless number. An answer built that way came back as 41.9 days against
-- a true 81.2: not a rounding difference, a different universe. Money is the
-- only measure that adds up across a catalogue.

--   DIAGNOSTIC    is there open demand, how big, and when is the next delivery
--   PRESCRIPTIVE  how much short we are once stock and incoming are counted
--

-- CURRENT_DATE, as asked. But the burn RATE behind days_of_cover divides by the
-- days in that window that could actually contain data (issuance currently ends
